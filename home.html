            <p>The "Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI" is an interactive and data-driven solution designed to help businesses monitor and analyze their sales performance effectively. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key sales metrics, including total revenue, profit margins, sales trends, and customer insights. By leveraging Power BI’s visualization capabilities, it enables users to track regional and product-wise sales, assess the performance of sales representatives, and identify patterns that impact overall business growth. With interactive filtering options and real-time data updates, users can drill down into specific metrics, compare performance across different time periods, and make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies. The dashboard also integrates forecasting and AI-driven insights to predict future sales trends, helping businesses stay ahead of market demands. Built using Power BI, SQL, and DAX, this project streamlines data analysis, enhances reporting efficiency, and empowers organizations with actionable intelligence for better revenue management.

            <h3><a href=https://github.com/Shashank0652/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA- target="_blank">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</a></h3>
            <P>The "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" project is designed to analyze and visualize datasets to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Using "Jupyter Notebook" as the development environment and "NumPy" for numerical computations, this project involves cleaning, transforming, and summarizing raw data to extract meaningful insights. Various statistical measures, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, are used to understand data distributions, while visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots help in identifying outliers and correlations. The project focuses on handling missing values, detecting anomalies, and preparing the dataset for further machine learning or predictive analysis. By leveraging "NumPy’s" efficient array operations and Jupyter’s interactive interface, this EDA process ensures a deeper understanding of the data, aiding in better decision-making and model development.</P>
